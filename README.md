Wow. Just. Wow. Contraataque, man. wild ride... can't quite... still kicking, like, echoes ringing in my brain between my ears. You know that feeling when you've just walked out and everything's blurring b/c you’vet been in the dark so long? Kinda like that. Except with explosions and maybe an elephant sized headache 🐘💥.

The pacing was nuts, like, they piled on scene after SCENE. That car chase–dude, I swear I felt the wind, or maybe it was just the AC being too aggressive, theater getting a bit chilly. But the sound! The CRUNCH of metal against metal... was like popcorn in a kettle, right before it all blows up. Except this time, it was right next to my face. 💯

Someone spilled popcorn near my seat, or was it me? Who knows... it’s all a blur. My back is killing me, those seats aren’t meant for humans. Feels like I just went through my own action scene, but without the fun part, just aches. Why can’t they make seats like clouds? And the hero, man, his one-liners sharper than the diamonds I'm used to cutting, could slice through any plot hole (there were a few).

> That moment, though, when the main dude, or was it the villain? whipped out the 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 – like some ancient goblet – some Indiana Jones vibes. And how they made all time pause. Or speed up. I wish time zipped by like that when I was polishing a necklace. Ghosts of time ticking loudly... echoooes.

Was I supposed to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for Ted? Or was that Stevie who asked? Oh man, kinda want to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, to piece together the bits or just for that soundtrack. Deafening. In a good way? Not sure. Like fireworks, but inside my eyeballs. 🎇🔥

And and and, how about that, uh, dog? Did he have a dog? I'm hundred-percent sure there was a dog who knew how to drive better than Jeff. Or maybe there wasn’t one? Whatever. It felt RIGHT THERE, somehow that made total sense in the moment. Was my popcorn extra salty or did I imagine that whole scene??

I still got crumbs on me—real or just shadows? Make the memories more tangible than the script, ofc. Wanna go back, but why go through all that again... life's exhausting enough without added locust swarms of bullets. Speaking off... did anyone clean the mess, that pool of... not blood, maybe coke, soda slip n slide?

    printf(Hello Contraataque!
); // what in the alarming cluster of thoughts...
    return 0;
    // blip at the end of my mind... or program, something unfinished I guess.
